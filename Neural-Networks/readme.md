# Neural Networks

This project implements a three-layer artificial neural network.

## Commands

- To run the backpropagation algorithm on the bank-note dataset:  
  `jupyter notebook HW_5_2a.ipynb`

- To run the stochastic gradient descent algorithm on the bank-note dataset:  
  `jupyter notebook HW_5_2b.ipynb`

- To run the training algorithm with all weights initialized to 0 on the bank-note dataset:  
  `jupyter notebook HW_5_2c.ipynb`

- To run the algorithm using PyTorch on the bank-note dataset:  
  `jupyter notebook HW_5_2e.ipynb`

## Dataset Location

Ensure the dataset location is updated according to your system configuration, as the given paths are for a local folder. The bank-note dataset is required for all notebooks.
