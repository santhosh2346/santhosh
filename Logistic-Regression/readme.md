# Logistic Regression

This project implements a Logistic Regression model with stochastic gradient descent.

## Commands

- To run the MAP estimation on the bank-note dataset:  
  `jupyter notebook HW_5_3a.ipynb`

- To run the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation on the bank-note dataset:  
  `jupyter notebook HW_5_3b.ipynb`
