# Perceptron

This code implements the standard, voted, and averaged Perceptron algorithms, calculating the average test error for each.

# Usage

To run each Perceptron variation on the bank-note dataset:

- For the standard Perceptron, execute:
  ```
  jupyter notebook HW_3_2a.ipynb
  ```

- For the voted Perceptron, execute:
  ```
  jupyter notebook HW_3_2b.ipynb
  ```

- For the averaged Perceptron, execute:
  ```
  jupyter notebook HW_3_2c.ipynb
  ```
